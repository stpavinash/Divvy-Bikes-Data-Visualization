# Divvy-Bikes-Data-Visualization

I've used the Divvy Challenge dataset from the Divvy bikes in Chicago to produce a single visualization with the dataset. 
Below are some guidelines given as part of the contest. 
"Explore the data to see how Chicago gets around by bike by visualizing over 3.2 million Divvy trips in an insightful, beautiful, 
or creative way."
